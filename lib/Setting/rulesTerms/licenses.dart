If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely.\n\n   4.4. You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, TeleSign or any mobile communications carrier.\n\n    4.5. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that TeleSign has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through your applications developed with the SDK, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which TeleSign may suffer) by doing so.\n\n    4.6. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that TeleSign has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under this License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which TeleSign or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.\n\n    5.

Privacy and Information\n\n    6.1.

You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, this License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.\n\n    8. Using TeleSign APIs\n\n    8.1. If you use any API to send or retrieve data to or from TeleSign, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by TeleSign or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
